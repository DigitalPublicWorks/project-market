# Milwaukee Open Project Marketplace

Technology can be a huge benefit to a community if it is tailored to their specific needs. 
However, creating such specific software can be hard to fund. The Milwaukee Open Technology Market 
is a way for the residents of the city to speak directly to the people making software here, so 
they can collaborate to make living in Milwaukee better.

## Premise

The goal of this application is to build a web application similar to 
[kickstarter.com](http://www.kickstarter.com) which enables citizens of the Greater
Milwaukee Area to request that products or services be provided, and can collect support
and/or funding for the projects through the platform. Members of the Milwaukee community
who have the expertise to execute the proposed projects can then submit proposals to the 
projects, and ultimately work on executing the project. The platform will provide communication
tools to facilitate execution of the project and communication between the creators of the project
and the community/stakeholers. See [the U.S Digital Services Playbook](https://playbook.cio.gov/) 
for a framework on how projects on the system will be run.
